# National Parks API App

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to access data from an API based on user input.

### Homepage

When the use first lands on the site they are asked to enter two pieces of data:
- The two character state abbreviation, regardless of case, they're looking for national parks information in.
- How many responses back from the API they want to see.
- If the state has less parks than the custom asked to see they will see all parks for that state.

After the user inputs their informaiton and clicks the "Submit" button they will be provided with the results based on the state and total number of responses they want.
